# Technical-Interview

## Description

This repository provides a collection of technical problems designed for real-world interviews. Each problem is aimed at evaluating a candidate's technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and their thought process. These examples are valuable for interviewers seeking structured problems and solutions to assess candidates effectively.

For each problem, you will find:
- A brief description of the task from a client’s perspective.
- A technical overview of the problem and constraints.
- An ideal solution implemented in either Python or JavaScript.
- Sample test cases and outputs for validation.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate best practices for conducting technical interviews by sharing examples of challenges that encourage critical thinking and efficient coding.

**Note:** Some of the material in this repository has been generated with the help of AI to enhance the quality and variety of the problems presented.

## Usage

To explore each problem:
1. Navigate to the `examples/` directory.
2. Open any of the problem folders to view its `README.md` and the solution file in `.js` or `.py`.
3. Review the problem's description, expected outputs, and the ideal solution code.

Each problem folder contains:
- **Problem Brief**: A client-centric description of the problem.
- **Technical Overview**: A breakdown of the problem’s requirements and constraints.
- **Ideal Solution**: An example solution in Python or JavaScript.
- **Test Cases**: Sample inputs and expected outputs to validate the solution.

### Example Problems
